#Front End Curiosity
>Curiosity demands to be extinguished. Start where you know and dig into the places words fail you. Mastery is then inevitable.

##General Format
This project is modeled off of Feynman Journals. During his preparation for his physic quals Richard Feynman took empty
journals and began to write down every thing he knew about physics. When he found a place he could not explain simply,
as if to a child, that is when he returned to the primary sources. This ethos of preparing to answer any question, of
understanding the why of everything allowed him to create some of the most elegant explanations to the worlds most 
complicated problems. 

I am creating a web page to capture my Feynman Journal of the front end of web development. Finalizing such a document
is a Sisyphean task, the ecosystem grows deeper and broader every day. However, just because perfection is impossible
does not mean it should not be strode for. These are the medium I will work with to create my road.

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Drawings

In so doing I will both record my learnings on the subject at hand while also applying it practically.
