    <h2>Why is Positioning Important</h2>
        <p>
            The combination of HTML and CSS to structure a web page are of first class concern. If a user experiences any
            friction when using a web page or application they are going to be frustrated and potentially leave. The way
            that we choose to lay out our page is therefore critical. I am yet unsure if it is more important than the
            service performing well. Which is more important: a beautiful but slow page or a clunky but fast one?
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore my first main thrust must be how to control where elements are placed upon an html page. Given the
            intertwined nature of our subject matter this will by necessity generate pages on other topics. I encourage
            you to follow the rabbit hole of hyperlinks. You should walk this text rather than follow it.
